what is the createMapTask method for?

should mappers create their own counts, or just pass '1' to some reducers
(like "the") multiple times

it seems like createReduceTask should be a method on a iReducerFactory/Manager
class, though that's not as you're intending it seems...

what is the iReducer returned by createReduceTask? not self, right?
